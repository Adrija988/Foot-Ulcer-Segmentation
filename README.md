# Foot-Ulcer-Segmentation
Implemented a deep learning-based approach for foot ulcer segmentation to assist in diabetic wound assessment. The model performs precise pixel-level segmentation of ulcer regions using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) {Attention - UNet ++ Architecture}  on annotated medical images. 
It includes data preprocessing, augmentation, model training, and evaluation using metrics such as Dice coefficient, IoU, and accuracy, enabling automated and accurate ulcer detection.

# Dataset:
This repository contains the dataset and implementation related to the Foot Ulcer Segmentation (FUSEG) Challenge, aimed at developing automated methods to segment foot ulcers from clinical images. Foot ulcer detection is crucial for early diagnosis and management of diabetic foot complications.
