# Foot-Ulcer-Segmentation
Implemented a deep learning-based approach for foot ulcer segmentation to assist in diabetic wound assessment. The model performs precise pixel-level segmentation of ulcer regions using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) {Attention - UNet ++ Architecture}  on annotated medical images.
